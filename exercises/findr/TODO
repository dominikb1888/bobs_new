# findr

## Problem Statement

I am a terminal user and I do not like to manually walk through each directory and note down a certain file following a certain naming pattern. Using cd and ls is tedious.

## Solution Description

I want a program that finds all files with a specific naming pattern for me. So, I do not have to use cd and ls for finding things in different folders anymore.


## Needs/Requirements

As a termin user, I want to

- search any folder from anywhere, because switching directories is one more step and I might want to stay in my current context
- get a list of files matching names or patterns, because sometimes I do not remember the file name exactly
- get a count of the files found, because this helps me to do sanity checks on the patterns
- use the output of find with other CLI tools

Scoping - What do I have to do and what can I reuse? E.g. Counting (count) or numbered lists (cat -n) form other CLI tools.

General Requirements:
- Easy to use/User friendly
- Fast
- Fault tolerant
- Safe

## Features/Implementation

- We need to take a path as an argument
- We need to know which files and folders are inside this directory
- Look through all files in current directory
- Recursively look through all files in child directories
- Compare the file name/pattern with all files found in the local and child directories
- We need to send our data to STDOUT

Arguments:
- path
- pattern

## Prototyping
1. Make search (aka traversal through directories) from current path without a pattern possible
2. take a path as an argument, validate it and traverse
3. take a pattern and a path as an argument validate each and traverse
