# Develop Digital Business Skills

This course is an unusual introduction to business and entrepreneurship for computer science students. We will build an actual command-line tool and attempt to market it via a custom website. In this process we will understand how computers work and how we can market software on the web.

- [announcements](announcements.md),
- a [course calendar](calendar.md),
- a [staff](staff.md) page,


## Prerequisites

- A computer with a Linux Distribution of your choice installed.
- On Windows: Use virtualization tools like Virtualbox or VMware.
- On a Mac, you do not need to do anything you are already on a Unix-based OS
- 

## Class Design

Our class is split into three sections:

1. Lecture: Understanding Computers and Computation (60-90 min)
2. Exercise: Building Command-Tools (60-90 min)

In addition, there will be an option tutorial providing an introduction to the Rust Programming Language

## Reading:

- Lecture: [The Secret Life of Programs](https://nostarch.com/foundationsofcomp)
- Exercise: [Command-Line Rust](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/th-deggendorf/detail.action?docID=6853886&query=rust)
- Tutorial: [Programming Rust](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/th-deggendorf/detail.action?docID=6643397&query=rust)

## Additional Reading:
- The Linux Programming Interface

- # General Business and Accounting

This will be an unusual introduction to business and accounting. One targeted at future developers. We will start with you, because business starts with you. Let's understand many concepts of the business world by understanding how to use your computing environment in the most optimal way for you. This means understanding operating systems, shells, and customization options. We will be reflecting on efficiency, productivity and automation. Working our way up to the market, where you need to position yourself as a developer and compete with others. Building your personal profiles and understanding collaborative systems like Git and Github is key. Building and maintaining your digital identity by sharing learning and projects will help foster your personal development. Reflecting on this journey means looking at accounting and budgeting your personal business/brand. Join us for the most unusual journey into the business world. It all starts with you.

## Structure

- Lecture: CS concepts (30-45min):
- Exercise: Rust Programming Practice (90-120 min)
- OS Customization und Developer Productivity (30-45 min)

## Goals - Understand operating systems and take first steps as a developer

- [] Understand the low levels of your operating system and how to program them in Rust
- [] Know and use modern command-line tools
- [] Setup and maintain your personal development environment


## Student Blogs

As part of the course you will pick and conduct a personal automation project and write a blog about it. You will start using the Rust Programming language and get a low-level headstart into programming.

## Exam and Class Project

- Reach out:  Create blog on Github Pages.
- Hands-on: Write at least 4 blog posts (1000 words each) on a command-line application you created in Rust (or another compiled language)
- Iterate: Make sure there is at least one week between each post, try and engage as many classmates as possible to use and feedback on your automation and blog content.
- Reflect: Feedback on both Automation Projects should be as specific as possible and in the form of Pull Requests.
