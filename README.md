# Develop Digital Business Skills

This will be an unusual introduction to business and accounting. One targeted at future developers. We will start with you and your personal vision, because business is all about people. We will accomplish both understanding many concepts of the business world and becoming more proficient in using your computing environment in the most optimal way for you. This means understanding operating systems, shells, and customization options. We will be reflecting on efficiency, productivity and automation. Working our way up to the market, where you need to position yourself as a developer and compete with others. Building your personal profile and understanding collaborative systems like Git and Github is key. Building and maintaining your digital identity by sharing your learnings and projects will help foster your personal development. Marketing an actual command-line application you built will help you understand the basics of Marketing and Business Models.

Join us for the most unusual journey into the business world. It all starts with you. From there we move to the market - bit by bit.
